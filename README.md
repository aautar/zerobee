# ZeroBee

A "zero build" documentation platform

ZeroBee will take markdown documents and create a static, singe-page, site instantly, without any prerequistie build process.

## Why?


## North star
- Zero-to-no repetition to minimize maintence burden from changes (e.g. titles are pulled from markdown files, not declared in config).
- "Batteries included" .. everything works out of the box with reasonable defaults (e.g. no custom web server configuration required)
- 


## Current limititations
- Page slugs are hashes, this allows for easy setup without worrying about configuring redirects on the web server
