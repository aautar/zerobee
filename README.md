# ZeroBee

A "zero build" documentation platform

ZeroBee will take markdown documents and create a static, singe-page, site instantly, without any prerequistie build process.

## Why?

## Current limititations
- Page slugs are hashes, this allows for easy setup without worrying about configuring redirects on the web server
